## {{ post.title }}

Made at Shooters Post and Transfer (now [Alkemy X](http://www.alkemy-x.com/)) for [Mangos](http://www.mangosinc.com/)

These end tags were inspired by Kyle Cooper. They echo the dynamism of Cannondale's new race bike, the SuperSix, ridden by Team Liquigas in the Tour de France.
